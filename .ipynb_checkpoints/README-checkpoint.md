## Subdirectory Details 
- / notebooks - contains notes that can be code based(jupyter) but can also non code base nbs (md, pdf) 


## .gitignore details 
For the sake of ease I created a gitignore file and placed /data in it. The reason for this is so that we can place any datasets into the a predetermined location without pushing that data to github. We can then run code without having to change target paths.
